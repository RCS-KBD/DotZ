# Testing Documentation for DotZ Game

## Overview
This document outlines the testing standards, procedures, and requirements for the DotZ game project.

## Test Structure

### File Organization
- All test files must be in the `tests/` directory
- Test files must be named `test_*.py`
- Each test file must focus on one component/feature

### Test Categories
1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test individual components in isolation
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Focus on specific functionality
   - Example: `test_utils.py`, `test_config.py`

2. **State Tests**
   - Test game state transitions
   - Verify state initialization
   - Check state event handling
   - Example: `test_game_states.py`

3. **Functionality Tests**
   - Test complete feature workflows
   - Verify component interactions
   - Test user input handling
   - Example: `test_game_state_functionality.py`

## Test Requirements

### Independence
- Tests must be independent and not rely on each other
- Each test must clean up its own resources
- Use setup and teardown when necessary

### Quality Standards
- Clear purpose and description
- Descriptive test names
- Proper resource cleanup
- Test isolation

### Coverage Requirements
- All new features require tests
- Critical mechanics need comprehensive tests
- State transitions must be fully tested
- Input handling must be verified

## Implementation Guidelines

### Mocking Standards
- Use pytest's monkeypatch
- Mock external dependencies
- Create realistic test data
- Document mock behavior

### Resource Management
- Clean up pygame resources
- Handle file system operations safely
- Manage memory efficiently
- Proper test isolation

## Maintenance

### Test Updates
- Keep tests up to date
- Remove obsolete tests
- Update tests with feature changes
- Document dependencies

### Documentation
- Document test purposes
- Explain test setup/teardown
- Note test dependencies
- Document mock behaviors

## Running Tests

### Commands
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_game_states.py -v

# Run specific test
pytest tests/test_game_states.py::test_state_transitions -v
```

### Pre-commit Requirements
- Run all tests before commits
- Test specific features when modified
- Verify no regressions
- Document test results

## Example Test Structure
```python
def test_feature_name():
    """Test description of what is being tested."""
    # Setup
    pygame.init()
    
    # Test implementation
    # ...
    
    # Assertions
    assert condition
    
    # Cleanup
    pygame.quit()
```
